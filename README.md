/* 
This repository contains my submission for Programming Assignment 1 in CSCI 460. The project explores the performance of a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier on the UCI Bank Marketing dataset. The main objective here is to basically evaulate classification accuracy and F1-score under different train/test splits to analyze how the performance changes as the amount of training data increases. In my report for the code, I can conclude that the code is working properly. It has run the 10 iterations and reported the average and standard deviation of accuracy and F1 scores. I've run it multiple times and I can conclude that it prints the same Mean and Standard Deviation. So, in other words the impact of splitting the data is constant, meaning it's staying the same based on my findings. I have not found any unusual behavior of my model examining the mean and standard deviation of each performance metric, as I said, it reports the same answer each time I run it.
